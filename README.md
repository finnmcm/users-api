I couldn't really understand the DISC videos very well so I just decided to watch a full hour long tutorial on YouTube and follow along. Most of my code is pretty identical to his but I think
I understand it all very well! My only problem currently is connecting this separate API project to my frontend for my website. I just don't really understand how it works or even how
to connect the two, which is something I'll have to look into.
